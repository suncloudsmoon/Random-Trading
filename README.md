# Random-Trading
Trader's Destiny (same project as Random Trading, but a cooler name) is a simple text-based game that aims to create total randomness in each of the scenarios generated. In this game, the main character is the trader, and the user has the ability to trade and negotiate (a feature to be added in the near future) and I hope to add multiple traders in the future :)! Besides, My main objective is to turn this game into a fully-fledged 2D game with unique characters and stunning graphics. Until then, any contributions to my hobby project is welcome!

Structure of this Java program (it is a little outdated):
- Trading_Hub.java: this file is where the main method lies
- Trader.java: this file explains the basic characteristic of the trader that the user interacts with
- Random_Trader_Name.java: In this file, randomly generated names are stored in a string
- Food_Trading.java: In this file, all food items that the trader has will be declared here
- Buying.java: In this file, all initial values for food and the amount of cash in the customer's wallet and the trader's cashbox will
be displayed here!

Side Note:

- The nickname "Popeye the sailor man" is the same user as suncloudsmoon!
